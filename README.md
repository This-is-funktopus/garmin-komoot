# Komoot-flavoured Garmin
A map that recreates the Komoot Map on Garmin's native navigation. Built using https://jnr.fi/garmin/ with help from this Garmin Forum thread: https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/cycling/f/edge-530/290989/how-to-make-course-line-easier-to-see?pifragment-1290=3#pifragment-1290=1

To set up your Komoot flavoured map, download the KTMF file and transer it to MAPTHEMES on your garmin device.

Then, navigate to the following:

STEP 1:

settings > activity profiles > [CHOOSE A PROFILE] > Navigation > Map > Appearance > Map Theme > [CHOOSE THE DOWNLOADED MAP]

This sets up the map.

STEP 2:

settings > activity profiles > [CHOOSE A PROFILE] > Navigation > Map > Appearance > Advanced > Zoom Levels [SET MAP POINTS AND STREET LABELS TO "OFF", SET SHADED RELIEF TO "DO NOT SHOW"]

This declutters the map.

STEP 3:

Ride!
